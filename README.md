# Laser Projector

CAD files and code for a project creating a laser projector rendering an image by rastering a laser beam across a screen with two quickly spinning mirrors.

See:

article.pdf

for a write-up of the project.

Useful CAD files (blender-CAD-modeling):

mirror-motor-mount/      ----    contains the .blend projet and STL of the printed tilted mirror motor mount piece, as well as code for computing the moment of inertia tensor of a mesh and visualizing it in real time, such that pieces can be placed so as to align the principal axes right.


laser-holder/    ----    contains .blend project and stl files for the laser holders - adjustable in height, pitch, and yaw, easaily adjustable then tightly secured by bolts.
